				 Persona Photo Lover
			</h1>
			<p> I am a photographer and I want to find and share photos that inspire me. I love browsing through other artist's work when I come across one that astonishes me, I hit favorite and save it to my profile for later. Usually I am on my laptop at home in the evening when I browse, I can get lost for hours on Photo Lover searching, sharing and saving. Sometimes when I need a break from work or studying at a cafe I will log on and browse for a short while to escape.

				Another wonderful service of Photo lover is the print service they provide. You can buy a printed version of your photos or another artist's. That's something I never learned how to do, making large scale prints the equipment alone is very expensive and you need skills I don't have to print them correctly.
