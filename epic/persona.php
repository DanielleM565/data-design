				 Persona Photo Lover on Etsy
			</h1>
			<p> I'm a Photographer and I want to share my photos to promote myself as an entrepreneur. On my profile I can promote a unique service as well as sell my work. I use Etsy to also follow and favorite other photographers and photos from other artist around the world. Usually I work from my laptop at home or in a cafe in the evening, editing my photos and posting them to my profile as well as browsing for ideas. When I see a photo from another artists that inspire me I hit favorite on their photo and save it for later. Etsy will also help me sell my photo prints so make extra money money selling my unique goods.

			<p>
				Another wonderful service of Photo lover is the print service they provide. You can buy a printed version of your photos or another artist's. That's something I never learned how to do, making large scale prints the equipment alone is very expensive and you need skills I don't have to print them correctly.
